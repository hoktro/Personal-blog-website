                    <p>1 x 1.6kg whole duck</p>
                    <p>2 heaped teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder</p>
                    <p>1 clementine</p>
                    <p>6 fresh bay leaves</p>

                    <em id = "head">GRAVY</em>
                    <p>1 bulb of garlic</p>
                    <p>2 carrots</p>
                    <p>2 red onions</p>
                    <p>3 tablespoons plain flour</p>
                    <p>100 ml Marsala</p>
                    <p>1 litre organic chicken stock</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class = "method">
                    <em id = "head">Method</em>
                    <p>1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4.</p>
                    <p>2. Remove any excess fat from inside the cavity of the duck, then using a sharp knife carefully score the breast and legs all over in crisscross fashion, roughly 1cm apart.</p>
                    <p>3. Season the duck with sea salt, black pepper and the five-spice, then rub all over so the flavour catches in all the nooks and crannies.</p>
                    <p>4. Halve the clementine and place into the cavity along with the bay leaves. Transfer the duck to a medium roasting tray and roast for around 1 hour 20 minutes.</p>
                    <p>5. Meanwhile, halve the bulb of garlic across the middle, then peel and roughly slice the carrots and onions.</p>
                    <p>6. When the time is up, remove the roasting tray from the oven. Carefully lift up the duck and scatter the veg into the tray to make a trivet. Sit the duck on top of the veg, then return the tray to the oven for a further 40 minutes, or until the duck is beautifully crisp and the meat falls easily away from the bone.</p>
                    <p>7. Once cooked to perfections, remove the duck to a plate to rest while you get on with the gravy.</p>
                    <p>8. Add the flour to the vegetables, then mash everything together with a potato masher, scraping up all the sticky goodness from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>9. Place over a medium-high heat, pour in the Marsala and leave to bubble and cook away, stirring well.</p>
                    <p>10. Add the stock, then bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer for around 15 minutes, or until thickened and reduced. Strain through a coarse sieve, skim away any fat from the surface, then season to taste.</p>
                    <p>11. Shred or carve up the duck, then serve with the gravy on the side. Nice with duck fat roast potatoes, seasonal greens and cranberry sauce.</p>

                    <em id = "head">Tips</em>
                    <p>Support your local duck farmers – look for free-range farms in your area and help the British farming industry. Free-range ducks have freedom to roam outdoors and the provision of open water, allowing them to display their natural instincts of splashing and swimming. Living a good life generally means they have better flavour and texture.</p>
