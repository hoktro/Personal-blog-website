                    <p>125 g unsalted butter , at room temperature</p>
                    <p>250 g unrefined light brown sugar</p>
                    <p>1 large free-range egg</p>
                    <p>1 teaspoon peppermint extract</p>
                    <p>50 g cocoa powder</p>
                    <p>1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
                    <p>150 g wholemeal flour</p>
                    <p>60 g plain flour , plus extra for dusting</p>
                    <p>2-3 candy canes</p>

                    <em id = "head">CHOCOLATE ICING</em>
                    <p>100 g icing sugar</p>
                    <p>50 g cocoa powder</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class = "method">
                    <em id = "head">Method</em>
                    <p>1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4 and line 2 baking sheets with baking paper.</p>
                    <p>2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</p>
                    <p>3. Beat the egg and stir into the mixture with the peppermint extract, cocoa powder and a tiny pinch of sea salt, mixing until the cocoa is integrated and the batter is smooth and creamy, with the consistency of thick icing.</p>
                    <p>4. Add the baking powder and flours, and mix until the batter comes together (don't worry if it’s slightly crumbly).</p>
                    <p>5. Turn out the dough onto a floured work surface and knead it just once or twice to bring it together.</p>
                    <p>6. Split it in half, flatten each piece into 2½cm-thick discs, then wrap them both in clingfilm. Chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.</p>
                    <p>7. Once cool, unwrap the dough onto a well-floured surface and roll it out very thin (about 2½mm thick).</p>
                    <p>8. Using a 6cm round cutter, stamp out the cookies. You can make them bigger or smaller if you like – you’ll just need to watch the cooking time.</p>
                    <p>9. Place the cookies on the prepared baking trays and use a skewer to pierce little holes at the top for threading the ribbon.</p>
                    <p>10. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until firm.</p>
                    <p>11. Remove from the oven, transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool completely.</p>
                    <p>12. Make the icing by sifting the icing sugar and cocoa into a bowl, then gradually add a few drops of hot water until you have a smooth but thick consistency.</p>
                    <p>13. When the cookies have completely cooled, slather them with a little icing and top with the crushed-up candy canes.</p>
                    <p>14. Once the icing is set, thread with ribbon and hang from the tree. These will keep for 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
