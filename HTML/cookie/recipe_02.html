                    <p>100 g spelt or wholemeal flour</p>
                    <p>1 teaspoon ground mixed spice</p>
                    <p>½ teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</p>
                    <p>250 g porridge oats</p>
                    <p>100 g raisins, sultanas or whichever dried fruit you like</p>
                    <p>25 g mixed seeds , such as pumpkin, sunflower, flaxseed, sesame</p>
                    <p>100 g unsalted butter , (at room temperature)</p>
                    <p>50 g golden caster sugar</p>
                    <p>50 g soft brown sugar</p>
                    <p>1 large free-range egg</p>

                    <em id = "head">Method</em>
                    <p>1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 5 and line 2 large baking trays with greaseproof paper.</p>
                    <p>2. Tip the flour, mixed spice, bicarbonate of soda, oats, dried fruit (roughly chop up any bigger pieces of fruit first) and seeds into a large bowl and mix together well.</p>
                    <p>3. In another large bowl, cream the soft butter and sugars together until light and fluffy. Crack in the egg and beat to combine.</p>
                    <p>4. Tip in all the dry ingredients and stir together – it should come together, but you might need to squelch it together with your hands to get everything properly combined.</p>
                    <p>5. At this stage, the mixture will be sticky, but if you wet your hands, you will be able to it roll into walnut-sized balls – you should get around 24 in total. As you roll them, place them onto the lined baking trays, squashing them down a little with the palm of your hand.</p>
                    <p>6. Bake in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly golden and slightly soft in middle.</p>
                    <p>7. Once cooked, remove from the oven and when cool enough to handle transfer them to wire racks to cool a little – they’re delicious warm, but equally good cold. Keep in an air-tight container for up to 5 days.</p>
                    
                    <em id = "head">Tips</em>
                    <p>Try swapping the mixed spice for ground spices, such as cinnamon or ginger instead, for a bit of a change.</p>
