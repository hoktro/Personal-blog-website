                    <p>Â½ a small red onion</p>
                    <p>4 tablespoons red wine vinegar , or juice of 1 lemon</p>
                    <p>2 very ripe tomatoes</p>
                    <p>1 regular cucumber , or 2 small cucumbers</p>
                    <p>1 green pepper</p>
                    <p>1 carrot</p>
                    <p>handful of (ideally) Kalamata olives , the best you can get</p>
                    <p>1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
                    <p>olive oil</p>
                    <p>200 g feta</p>
                    <p>sea salt</p>

                    <!-- <em id = "head">Dressing</em>
                    <p>1 teaspoon English mustard</p>
                    <p>1 teaspoon wholegrain mustard</p>
                    <p>3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
                    <p>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</p>
                    <p>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</p>

                    <p>1. Slice the red onion as finely as you can into half moons. Put it in a salad bowl (a shallow bowl works best) and pour over half the vinegar, or squeeze over half the lemon, to temper its harshness.</p>
                    <p>2. Slice the tomatoes into slim wedges. If any of the juices seep out, swipe them with your hand into the lemony onions. Put the tomatoes into the salad bowl.</p>
                    <p>3. Slice the cucumber into quite chunky rounds and put them with the other veg.</p>
                    <p>4. Cut the pepper in half, deseed, and, if it is a big one, cut it in half lengthways again and then slice it across. Add it to the bowl.</p>
                    <p>5. Grate the carrot on the coarse side of a grater and add it, too, to the bowl.</p>
                    <p>6. Throw in the whole olives. If you have kids eating, you can pit the olives beforehand; I just smash them with the flat side of the knife and remove the stones.</p>
                    <p>7. Finally, make the dressing by whisking together the remaining vinegar or lemon juice and the oregano with oil and salt to taste. Stir it through the salad. Finely grate half the feta on top. I leave the remaining feta and the grater on the table, so everyone can top themselves up when needed..</p>
